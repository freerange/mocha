= Mocha {<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/freerange/mocha.png" />}[http://travis-ci.org/freerange/mocha]

Mocha is a library for mocking and stubbing using a syntax like that of {JMock}[http://www.jmock.org].

It can be used with many testing frameworks e.g. {Test::Unit}[http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/classes/Test/Unit.html], {RSpec}[http://rspec.info/], {test/spec}[http://chneukirchen.org/repos/testspec/README], {expectations}[http://expectations.rubyforge.org/], {Dust}[http://dust.rubyforge.org/], {MiniTest}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/bfts] and even {JtestR}[http://jtestr.codehaus.org/].

Mocha provides a unified, simple and readable syntax for both traditional mocking and partial mocking.

Mocha was harvested from projects at {Reevoo}[http://www.reevoo.com/] by me ({James}[http://jamesmead.org/]) and my (then) colleagues {Ben}[http://www.techbelly.com/], {Chris}[http://chrisroos.co.uk/] and {Paul}[http://po-ru.com/].

== Installation

Install the latest version of the gem with the following command...

  $ gem install mocha

Note that if you are intending to use Mocha with Test::Unit or MiniTest, you should only load Mocha *after* loading the relevant test library...

  require "test/unit"
  require "mocha"

If you're using Bundler, ensure the correct load order by not auto-requiring Mocha in the Gemfile and then later load it once you know the test library has been loaded...

  # Gemfile
  gem "mocha", :require => false

  # Elsewhere after Bundler has loaded gems
  require "test/unit"
  require "mocha"

Note that versions 0.10.2, 0.10.3 & 0.11.0 included a bug. Please do not use these versions.

Or install the {Rails}[http://www.rubyonrails.org/] plugin...

  $ script/plugin install git://github.com/freerange/mocha.git

Note that versions 0.9.6 & 0.9.7 of the Rails plugin were broken. As of version 0.9.8, you need to explicitly load Mocha after the test framework e.g. by adding "require 'mocha'" at the bottom of test/test_helper.rb.
