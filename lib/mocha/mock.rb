module Mocha
  # Traditional mock object.
  #
  # All methods return an {Expectation} which can be further modified by
  # methods on {Expectation}.
  #
  # Stubs and expectations are basically the same thing. A stub is just an
  # expectation of zero or more invocations. The {#stubs} method is syntactic
  # sugar to make the intent of the test more explicit.
  #
  # When a method is invoked on a mock object, the mock object searches through
  # its expectations from newest to oldest to find one that matches the
  # invocation. After the invocation, the matching expectation might stop
  # matching further invocations. For example, an +expects(:foo).once+
  # expectation only matches once and will be ignored on future invocations
  # while an +expects(:foo).at_least_once+ expectation will always be matched
  # against invocations.
  #
  # This scheme allows you to:
  #
  # - Set up default stubs in your the +setup+ method of your test class and
  #   override some of those stubs in individual tests.
  # - Set up different +once+ expectations for the same method with different
  #   action per invocation. However, it's better to use the
  #   {Expectation#returns} method with multiple arguments to do this, as
  #   described below.
  #
  # However, there are some possible "gotchas" caused by this scheme:
  #
  # - if you create an expectation and then a stub for the same method, the
  #   stub will always override the expectation and the expectation will never
  #   be met.
  # - if you create a stub and then an expectation for the same method, the
  #   expectation will match, and when it stops matching the stub will be used
  #   instead, possibly masking test failures.
  # - if you create different expectations for the same method, they will be
  #   invoked in the opposite order than that in which they were specified,
  #   rather than the same order.
  #
  # The best thing to do is not set up multiple expectations and stubs for the
  # same method with exactly the same matchers. Instead, use the
  # {Expectation#returns} method with multiple arguments to create multiple
  # actions for a method. You can also chain multiple calls to
  # {Expectation#returns} and {Expectation#raises} (along with syntactic sugar
  # {Expectation#then} if desired).
  #
  # @example
  #   object = mock()
  #   object.stubs(:expected_method).returns(1, 2).then.raises(Exception)
  #   object.expected_method # => 1
  #   object.expected_method # => 2
  #   object.expected_method # => raises exception of class Exception1
  #
  # If you want to specify more complex ordering or order invocations across
  # different mock objects, use the {Expectation#in_sequence} method to
  # explicitly define a total or partial ordering of invocations.
